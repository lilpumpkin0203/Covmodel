# Sars-Cov-2 Recognizing Assistant

This project involves the development of a graphical interface that is linked to a CNN Deep Learning model. The main objective is to identify the existence of the virus based on microscopic images of alveolar stem cells.

### Data Set source

- European Bioinformatics Institute, Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR)
- Ref: EMPIAR-10533
- Study Title: SARS-CoV-2 infection in human adult lung alveolar stem cells
- Link: [EMPIAR-10533](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-10533/)

### Used Libs

The project utilizes the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Scikit-image
- Scikit-learn
- cv2
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Streamlit

These libraries provide the necessary functionality for data manipulation, deep learning model development, image processing, visualization, and building the user-friendly graphical interface using Streamlit.
